      <p>Briana grew up on a tree farm in Maine, attended college in Massachusetts, and moved to North Carolina in 2014. She has long been fascinated by other countries and cultures, which led her to graduate with a degree in European Studies from Mount Holyoke College. After college, however, she fell into working in healthcare as a pharmacy technician, and since pursued other pharmacy-related jobs since moving to North Carolina (although she did serve as a sales representative for a GIS software developer for a time, as well). </p>

    <p>Briana is currently working for UNC Healthcare, at the North Carolina Cancer Hospital, Infusion Pharmacy, Investigational Drug Service. Much of her time is spent there preparing chemotherapy infusions for both inpatients and clinic patients, using aseptic technique and the BD Phaseal Closed System Transfer Device to minimize exposure during the hazardous drug compounding process. Most of her time, however, is spent working on a small team of two pharmacists and one other technician in dispensing investigational chemotherapy drugs. She assists with all aspects of IDS operations, from dispensing, to ordering, to meeting with monitors from clinical research organizations and overseeing drug destruction for expired and excess inventory. Briana is honored to be a part of the process which brings drugs and new treatment protocols to patients who need them, and to be doing so at the University of North Carolina. </p>

    <p>Briana is looking to expand her horizons and continue working in healthcare, in a more technical capacity, with data curation and management. She is excited to be beginning her journey in coding and is always on the lookout for new opportunities to learn! </p>

    <p>When not working, or learning to code, Briana enjoys spending time with her friends and family (most of her family is still in Maine, but she's developed a "North Carolina family" to spend time with here!), keeping touch with her family in Maine 
    (Especially her beloved 12-year-old nephew), gardening, reading, cooking, and laughing at her own--often very bad--jokes. She is also becoming a Tar Heel fan. </p>
